<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

In this project, I learned how to do data modeling with PostgreSQL and how build an ETL pipeline using Python.

I applied what I've learned on data modeling using these tools to build a table schema, and to write an ETL pipeline that transfers data from files in two local directories into these tables.
